                        A computer network is a group of computers that use a set of common communication protocols
                        over digital interconnections for the purpose of sharing resources located on or provided by the network nodes.
                    </b>
    
                    The interconnections between nodes are formed from a broad spectrum of 
                    telecommunication network technologies, based on physically wired, optical, 
                    and wireless radio-frequency methods that may be arranged in a variety of network topologies.

                <h2>Challenges of Computer Networks</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>
                        While computer networks provide numerous benefits, they also come with various challenges that can impact 
                        performance, security, and maintenance. Below are some of the key challenges:
                    </b>
                </p>
    
                <h5>1. Security Threats</h5>
                    <p>Networks are vulnerable to cyber threats such as hacking, malware, phishing, and data breaches. Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, leading to financial and reputational losses. Implementing firewalls, encryption, and regular security updates is essential to mitigate these risks.</p>
                    
                <h5>2. Bandwidth Limitations</h5>
                    <p>Bandwidth determines how much data can be transmitted over a network in a given time. Limited bandwidth can result in slow internet speeds, buffering issues, and decreased productivity, especially in high-traffic environments. Upgrading network infrastructure and implementing bandwidth management techniques can help optimize performance.</p>
                    
                <h5>3. Network Congestion</h5>
                    <p>When too many devices use a network simultaneously, congestion can occur, leading to slower data transfer and increased latency. This is common in public Wi-Fi networks or during peak usage hours. Traffic management strategies, such as Quality of Service (QoS) and load balancing, can help manage congestion.</p>
                    
                <h5>4. Hardware Failures</h5>
                    <p>Network hardware, such as routers, switches, and servers, can fail due to wear and tear, power surges, or manufacturing defects. Hardware failures can disrupt connectivity and cause downtime. Regular maintenance, redundancy planning, and backup hardware can minimize the impact.</p>
                    
                <h5>5. Software Compatibility Issues</h5>
                    <p>Different devices and systems may run on various operating systems and network protocols, leading to compatibility issues. Incompatibility can cause communication problems between devices, reducing network efficiency. Ensuring standardized protocols and regular software updates can help address this challenge.</p>
                    
                <h5>6. Data Loss</h5>
                    <p>Data transmitted over a network is susceptible to corruption, accidental deletion, or cyberattacks. Without proper backup solutions and data recovery strategies, businesses risk losing critical information. Implementing regular backups, encryption, and data redundancy methods can protect against data loss.</p>
                    
                <h5>7. Network Downtime</h5>
                    <p>Unplanned network outages can disrupt business operations, leading to financial losses and decreased productivity. Downtime can result from power failures, cyberattacks, hardware malfunctions, or misconfigurations. Implementing redundant systems, regular monitoring, and preventive maintenance can help reduce downtime.</p>
            
                <h5>8. Scalability Issues</h5>
                    <p>As organizations grow, their networking needs expand, requiring additional devices, users, and infrastructure. Poorly designed networks may struggle to accommodate growth, leading to performance degradation. Planning a scalable network architecture with cloud-based solutions can ensure long-term efficiency.</p>
                    
                <h5>9. Complexity</h5>
                    <p>Managing large-scale networks with multiple devices, servers, and security measures can be complex. IT administrators must deal with troubleshooting, configurations, and performance optimizations. Simplifying network design and using automation tools can help reduce complexity.</p>
                    
                <h5>10. Cost</h5>
                    <p>Building and maintaining a network requires significant investment in hardware, software, security measures, and skilled personnel. Ongoing costs, such as software licenses and maintenance, add to the expense. Organizations must balance cost-effectiveness with performance to ensure an optimal network infrastructure.</p>
